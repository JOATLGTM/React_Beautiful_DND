## About The Project

A react application that deals with drag and dropping items in two different columns. 

The component should take three parameters:

- available columns: an array of objects, each item is an object with “id” string property for unique identification and “name” string property for displaying like { id: “startTime”, name: “Start Time”}

- visible columns: an array of strings, each string is a reference to id property of previous array;

- and a number of fixed columns (fixed columns are shown with lock icon).
